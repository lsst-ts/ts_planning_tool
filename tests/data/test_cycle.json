    "description": "Primary focus for tonight will be Calibrations Rehearsal.<br />The expectation is that all the calibrations (standard and non-standard) should be completed before sunset.<br /><br />We know that AuxTel Pointing model has issues.<br />So the priority is to collect data on the calibration tests, other than going on Sky.<br /><br />This means that, even if you need to run calibration test cases overnight, do it.<br />Let's try to get data for BLOCK-T22 and BLOCK-T24.<br /><br />Run BLOCK-T23 only if there are no other options for the night (neither on Sky, nor closed dome).

        "Night Summary": "The following report belong to the AuxTel Night Log. \u00a0<br /><br />During the observing activities, we encountered several problems. First, the Scheduler failed to enable due to missing data in the EFD (OBS-149).\u00a0<br />In the daytime calibration section, we initially ran \"latiss_daily_calibrations\" which not passed the sequence, the script did not turn on the lamp, so we ran auxtel/calibration/power_on_alcalsys.py to resolve this step and calibrations were completed<br />Then AuxTel were prepared for on-sky tests with Tiago, who took over to perform the pointing test. Unfortunately test was not successful. Following the plan for tonight we prepared AuxTel for AuxTel linearity scan 2/3 but it resulted in a ValueError due to a discrepancy in exposure time parameters (check LogError on Rolex or Zephyr), also the AuxTel linearity scan 1/3 test was executed given the same discrepancy error. AuxTel was prepare for the Filter Scans Block and during the the test the Electrometer:201 went to FAULT, The filter scan BLOCK-T22 was rerun with a patch implemented by Tiago, which ignore the error and automatically re-enable the electrometer if it faults again.<br />Meanwhile, ComCam Calibrations for CR1 was not possible to enable ComCam with the script maintel/enable_comcam.py, execution fails.<br /><br />ToDo:<br />- Ensure the lamp functionality in latiss_daily_calibrations.<br />- Resolve discrepancy in AuxTel Linearity Scan parameters.<br />- Guarantee proper enabling of ComCam for testing.<br />- Monitoring the electrometer with the implemented patch.?<br />Final telescope status:<br />AuxTel shutdown: ATTCS parameters in standby.<br />AuxTel at park position. (az:0.0 deg - el:80 deg)<br />Dome park position.
